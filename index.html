                <p>I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far ... Lorem Ipsum's father was 
                    with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in 
                    order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's 
                    birth certificate is a fraud. I know words. My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. They’re bringing mistakes.
                    An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. I don't think anybody knows it was 
                    Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, 
                    and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. 
                    Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. Greater than ever before. He has words. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, 
                    but I don't know, maybe it was. I have a 10 year old son. I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. 
                    They’re bringing mistakes. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. It's an art you're basically born with. 
                    Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. That other text? We have so many things that we have to do better ... and certainly ipsum is one of them. 
                    You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text. 
                    Are they small words? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! He has words. I have a placeholding temperament. Look at that text! 
                    We have so many things that we have to do better ... and certainly ipsum is one of them.</p>
